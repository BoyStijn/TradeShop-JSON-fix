/**
 * This class contains all the classes of the core of the plugin.
 * The reason we are adding them to the docs are that the custom event framework
 * makes use of the {@link org.shanerx.tradeshop.objects.Shop} class,
 * and should only be used for read purposes, ie. accessing getters.

 *
 * NOTE: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THE PLUGIN'S INTERNAL DATA, NOT EVEN WITH SETTER METHODS,
