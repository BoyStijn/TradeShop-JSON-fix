/**
 * This package contains all classes belonging to the TradeShop Addon Framework (TSAF),
 * a framework which allows external plugins to listen in on Trade-events, so that they may enhance
 * Trading experience through the addition of external features.
 * To listen for our events, setup a normal Bukkit event listener with the correct event class.
 *
 * More information on the TSAF and the currently available addons on https://tradeshop.github.io.
 *
 * General Notes: do NOT use the constructors of the event classes. They are intended to be listened to, not called.
 * Misuse may cause major problems, and we are not responsible for any damages or loss of data.
